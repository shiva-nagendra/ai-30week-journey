#supervised vs unsupervised learning

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
#model.fit(x, y) #supervised: x has answers y

# Unsupervised is for:
# 	•	exploration
# 	•	segmentation
# 	•	anomaly detection

# Supervised is for:
# 	•	prediction
# 	•	decision-making
# 	•	business impact
