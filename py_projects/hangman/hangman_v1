#Hangman V1 – Playable Core

# 1. If guess length is not 1 OR not alphabetic → tell user & continue

    # 2. If guess already in guessed → tell user & continue

    # 3. If guess is in word → append to guessed and say "Good guess!"

    # 4. Else → reduce attempts by 1 and say "Wrong guess."

    # 5. (For V1) We'll just keep looping until attempts == 0
